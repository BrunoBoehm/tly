## Questions
- Why is add cityPlace posting after the get (it's supposed to be a .then)?
- Using a partial for the form Vs using a component and 2-way data binding (back to parent scope)
- When editing a nested city, how can it update the header title and desc?
- How to make texts also act as input (transforming element to input?)
- Why can't I move the edit and add sections in cities#show
